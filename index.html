The Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as Oculus Quest 2) is the best VR headset to buy for most people. It offers the most versatility and the best value in the most affordable package available.
<h3><a href="valve.html">Valve Index</a></h3>
<p>The Valve Index is an old dog in this market, but Valve's first, and so far only, VR headset remains one of the best that money can buy today. 
Unfortunately, in terms of resolution, the Index is lagging behind the rest of the market. The headset boasts dual 1440 x 1600 LCD panels for crisp but not mind-blowing image clarity. 
The variable refresh rate settings allow you to dial in displays to match your PC's performance, which is an incredible help when you have a less-powerful graphics card in your system. 
The Index supports 80, 90, 120, and 144 Hz configurations.</p>
